CurioDuinoOBS
=============
This is the on board software for the CurioDuino robot. This software is loaded onto the Arduino Uno to control an autonomous robot. The software makes use of the NilRTOS to ensure edge detection and other processing deadlines are met.

Dependencies
=============

IMPORTANT: These belong one directory higher than the CurioDuino folder, in a folder called "libraries". If they are not there, the Arduino IDE will not be able to find and use them.
